Biographia Literaria – Samuel Taylor Coleridge

> Children are capable, of course, of literary belief, when the story-maker's art is good enough to
> produce it. That state of mind has been called “willing suspension of disbelief.” But this does
> not seem to me a good description of what happens. What really happens is that the storymaker proves a successful “sub-creator.” He makes a Secondary World which your mind can
> enter. Inside it, what he relates is “true”: it accords with the laws of that world. You therefore
> believe it, while you are, as it were, inside. The moment disbelief arises, the spell is broken; the
> magic, or rather art, has failed. You are then out in the Primary World again, looking at the little
> abortive Secondary World from outside. If you are obliged, by kindliness or circumstance, to
> stay, then disbelief must be suspended (or stifled), otherwise listening and looking would
> become intolerable. But this suspension of disbelief is a substitute for the genuine thing, a
> subterfuge we use when condescending to games or make-believe, or when trying (more or
> less willingly) to find what virtue we can in the work of an art that has for us failed.
