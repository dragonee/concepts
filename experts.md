10000 hours are not sufficient

1. Repeated attempts with feedback
   1. Reduce feedback loop. 3 minutes to check are better than 1 hour to
   check better than year to check
   2. Chess can be mastered, instruments can be mastered, engineering
   and other technical tasks can be mastered
   3. Complex adaptive systems have no predicting power. You can learn to
   stay afloat. These systems require a lot of small repeated experiments too.
   4. The more efficient your feedback loop cycle, the better you go.
2. Valid environment
   1. Gambling is random (for humans), you won't become an expert 
   in that anytime soon.
3. Timely feedback
   1. Immediate feedback are what we look for
   2. We take up noise as feedback where there's none
   3. We have problem with interpreting any delayed feedback
   4. Consequences a year down the line are basically impossible for us
   to comprehend.
4. Don't get too comfortable - you lose alertness when too much of the
same work performed
   1. Practice at the edge of the ability
   2. Classical musicians know that
   3. It's called deliberate practice
   4. Coaches and teachers in chess see your weakness and assign tasks to
   address them.

The goal is to build memory from System 2 to System 1 to automatically
respond in situations that can be automatically answered and preserve
alertness otherwise.

In stagnation situation, introduce chaos to raise alterness levels.
