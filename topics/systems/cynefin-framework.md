# Cynefin Framework

Cynefin framework is a sense-making framework used to aid decision-making.

By sense-making, we mean that the framework is useful in determining the context and methods of navigation in the environment based on the certain phenomena we can observe. A simpler explanation is ["How do we make sense of the world so we can act in it"](https://thecynefin.co/what-is-sense-making/).

By applying techniques found in Cynefin, we can, for example, map out things we can observe around us and gain a bit more insight on the things that we can manipulate and what we cannot. Such application helps us structure problems.
