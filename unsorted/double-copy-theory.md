> The double copy is, in essence, a map between scattering amplitudes in a broad variety of familiar field and string theories. In addition to the mathematically rich intrinsic structure, it underlies a multitude of active research directions and has a range of interesting applications in quantum, classical and effective field theories, including broad topics such as string theory, particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. This Snowmass white paper provides a brief introduction to the double copy, its applications, current research and future challenges.

This theory poses a mathematical similarity between gravity and gauge theory and suggests, that scattering amplitudes in different theories can be represented in a certain way "such that replacement of the color factor by additional kinematic dependence factor, in a well-defined way, automatically leads to gravity scattering amplitudes", quoting Wikipedia.

If that theory is developed more, that might have a big ramifications for uniting GR and QFT and can give us a glimpse into what might lie behind the two of them.

This theory also has practical applications, for example in computing solutions to gravity wave equations of colliding large-mass bodies.
