# Hindsightful

(coined by my friend Piotr)

A feature of a successfully finished series of trials and errors that
repeating the result is usually faster when achieved once.

Some achieved success, solution or knowledge is hindsightful when
there's a lot of implicit (tacit) knowledge about the process that needs
to be learned by trying to achieve this goal. Knowledge such as:

- what works where;
- what doesn't work;
- how the [rules of a game](gra.md) change with modifications;
- etc.

History of science is full of hindsightfulness, as the discoveries are
usually made and then repeated until these are recombined in such a way
that makes progress on the existing body of knowledge.

It also means that with all of this knowledge, a civilization could be
rebuilt (with sufficient manpower) a lot faster than it discovered
itself for the first time. There are a lot of books on this subject, 
and it will always be fascinating people what is the limit and the
"guaranteed" path to achieve this.

Maybe such preparation will prove useful in the future (under the
_Canticle for Leibowitz_ scenario).
