| Model                  | Core Process                                      | What Makes It Dynamic        | Best Context                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Kolb**               | Experience → Reflect → Conceptualize → Experiment | Learner cycles through modes | Foundational experiential learning |
| **Boud/Walker**        | Reflection central to learning                    | Emotion/context matter       | Professional learning              |
| **Gibbs**              | Structured emotional reflection                   | Actionable feedback loop     | Clinical/teacher training          |

| **Expansive Learning** | Contradiction-driven growth                       | System-level evolution       | Teams, innovation                  |
| **Double Loop**        | Challenge assumptions                             | Adaptive self-correction     | Strategic learning                 |

> Integrative Model (Visual Idea)
> 
> Imagine:
> 
> Kolb’s cycle as a horizontal cognitive loop (experience → reflection → concept → action)
>
> TBR’s 4Cs as vertical scaffolding (classroom structure that guides movement through that loop repeatedly)
>
> They form a spiral learning architecture — each iteration increasing complexity, ownership, and abstraction.

| **Kolb’s Cycle**                                                            | **TBR Framework**                                                                                   | **Conceptual Overlap**                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Concrete Experience (CE)** — Doing, trying, sensing                       | **“Connections”** — Engage learners immediately through interaction, reflection on prior experience | Both start by **activating existing schemas** and engaging emotionally + physically. |
| **Reflective Observation (RO)** — Reviewing and reflecting on what happened | **“Concepts”** — Learners make meaning, organize and label their experience                         | Reflection drives meaning-making; both emphasize **metacognition**.                  |
| **Abstract Conceptualization (AC)** — Forming theories, generalizing        | **“Concrete Practice”** — Learners apply and test new ideas                                         | Both shift from reflection to **building frameworks** or testing hypotheses.         |
| **Active Experimentation (AE)** — Trying out new knowledge in action        | **“Conclusions & Celebrations”** — Learners plan next steps, articulate takeaways, commit to action | Each closes the loop through **action planning and reinforcement**.                  |


## Against I-Space and Kolb's ELT

> Both cycles describe a dynamic transformation between tacit and explicit forms of knowing — but Kolb focuses on psychological and cognitive processes of individuals, whereas Boisot focuses on information and social diffusion processes across systems.

| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Core metaphor**        | Learning as transformation of experience   | Knowledge as movement through information space |
| **Epistemic movement**   | Concrete ↔ Abstract                        | Contextual ↔ Codified                           |
| **Ontological movement** | Tacit → Conceptual → Tacit                 | Uncodified → Codified → Uncodified              |
| **Level of analysis**    | Individual (micro)                         | Organizational / societal (macro)               |
| **Driving forces**       | Reflection, experimentation                | Codification, diffusion                         |
| **Outcome**              | Adaptive learning, personal transformation | Organizational intelligence, cultural evolution |


> If we imagine the I-Space as the landscape, Kolb’s learning cycle is the engine that moves an individual through it.
