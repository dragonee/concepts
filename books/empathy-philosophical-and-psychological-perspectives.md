# Empathy, Philosophical and Psychological Perspectives

- Amy Coplan
- Peter Goldie

This book is divided into articles written by different authors. From the look of it, it seems as these are standalone items that can be read independent from each other. There are a couple of chapters I'm starting with first.

## Introduction

Hume and Smith – the term is called sympathy, and for the discussion in this book, Hume's idea is stripped down to "psychological mechanism that enables the fast and instantaneous spread of emotion". Smith takes a "perspective-taking" approach.

> Regardless of whether sympathy for Smith is self - or other-oriented, it is usually described as a high-level process involving an imaginative component. In this respect, Smith's concept differed from Hume's. Whereas Hume's notion of sympathy is akin to what we call low-level empathy or mirroring, Smith's primary use of the terms refers to what we call high-level empathy, essentially involving imagination.

The concept of Einfühlung, context: late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Robert Vischer (1873) and Theodor Lipps (1903). Vischer used it in aesthetics, and Lipps used two-meaning to explain both how people experience aesthetic objects and how they come to know others' mental states.

Einfühlung – "feeling into" – inner resonance of perception and imitation

> inner imitation and inner resonance that is based on a natural instinct and causes us to imitate the movements and expressions we perceive in physical and social object. We experiecne the other's feelings as our own because we project our own feelings onto the other. In a similar way, we experience the properties of asthetic objects as our own, because, according to Lipps, asthetic objects elicit the same responses in us that are elicited by expressions and movements of the body, and we project these inner subjective qualities onto them.

Einfühlung -> greek _empatheia_, Edward Titchener 1909 in _Elementary Psychology of Thought Processes_.

Intersubjectivity (a problem of others' minds) concerns whether or not and how we can know others' mental states. 

Solutions:

- argument from analogy (they think the same as we are)
- appeal to empathy (Husserl and Stein) - unique mode of consciousness through which we directly experience others' thoughts, emotions and desires

Lipps notion of empathy includes (in the view of Husserl and Stein) some kind of "oneness", which they find deeply problematic, promoting a others-without-loss-of-self view.

### Willhelm Dithley and hermeneutics

As context, hermeneutics was a reason to separate out natural sciences and human sciences.

Natural sciences seek Erklären - an explanation that's ahistorical.

Human sciences do not have the courtesy of that and need to go through the process of Verstehen – understanding, which involves reenactment of a subject's state of mind. Different reeenactments produce different interpretations, and it's even more complex than that, because interpretations beget interpreations, and thus, a hermeneutic cycle is born.

What's important there, there's an empathic component in all of Verstehen.

> Interestingly, the complications regarding his view have to do with the same sort of conceptual confusion surrounding empathy today.

Now, in constrast to my statement that Verstehen has an empathic component, the book continues here with the problems of stating that Verstehen is the same as empathy.

Now what's interesing is that "thinkers within the hermeneutic traidtion ultimately dissmiessed empathy as a process capable of litle other than occasionally helping us to understand those very similar to us" – but not to interpret cross-cultural texts (my personal view, that's too simplistic, as we can work on ourselves being closer to more cultures, and especially with another person, we can contrast our viewpoints. Might be a thing with text sources, however).

So coming into 2000s, we're no longer into thinking that empathy is a primary method of the human sciences.

> Most philosohpers of social science have taken a much stronger position and denied empathy any role in the interpretation of others' actions and mental states. This attitude, according to Stueber, stems from theorists's association of empathy with a Cartesian conception of mind, which is now considered highly suspect on all philosophical traditions

I don't understand the above sentence. Seems important.

Carl Rogers and Heinz Kohut contributed to raise of empathy in psychology and related fields.

In Developmental psychology, there were many approaches to (and that's intresting to further search)

1. constructing objective scales to study empathy
2. the development of empathy in the individual
3. empathy's role in pro-social and pro-altruistic behaviour
4. empathic accuracy
5. gender differences in empathic reasoning

Still no consensus on the definition of empathy.

> Nancy Eisenberg and Janet Strayer offer a more specific definition but retain the same basic idea, characterizing empathy as "an affective response that stems from the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state of condition, and that is identical or very similar to what the other person is feeling or would be expected to feel"

In contrast to other sources, literature on empathic accuracy conceptualizes that as an inferential process through which a subject comes to know another person's mental states.
