# Discussion of positive-negative relationship

## 5:1 positive-negative ratio

What this video adheres to is probably 
[Predicting Marital Happiness and Stability from Newlywed Interactions](https://www.jstor.org/stable/353438) by Gottman, Coan,
Carrere and Swanson.

Haven't read the whole paper and I have little clue how much the claims
stood the test of time. I've found some published information that indeed the 
_Gottman therapy of couples_ has positive impact on couples. Therefore,
let's assume that the study is valid, at least in some sense.

The abstract claims 80% accuracy of marriage satisfaction and 83% on
whether the couple will divorce or not, which is profound.

It also introduces different models and in the _Balance models_ section
on page 8 and 9 the aspect ratio is presented.

> Gottman (1994) reported that in three types of stable marriages that 
> he identified, the ratio of positive to negative interaction 
> during conflict resolution was 5 to 1, whereas the 
> ratio was .8 to 1 in unstable marriages.

However, a few paragraphs before it also cites another study:

> The ratio of pleases to displeases in Birchler, Weiss, and 
> Vincent's study (1975) also discriminated between the groups. 
> (The ratio was 29.66 for nondistressed couples 
> and 4.30 for distressed couples.)

As per using the _conflict resolution_ term in the first quote and
different ratios, I'm still a little bit uncertain if 5:1 is not a
gross oversimplication of the body of research conducted on the topic.

## 11:1 positive-negative ratio

As suggested in the Gottman study, removing all negative interactions
from a relationship would be a kind of abomination – a declaration of 
_war on negative affect_. However, no specific ratios are specified
in the study.

Another paper by [Fredricson and Losada (2011)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3126111/)
uses ratio of 2.9 in people in general as a bifurcation point of the
proposed model and presents other studies as supportive for the model
(Schwartz's 4.3 and Gottman's 5 are given as an example).

0.5 and 0.8 are given as examples of people suffering clinical
depression and divorcing couples.

Then, an upper limit is introduced.

> Past mathematical work
on Lorenz equations (Frøyland & Alfsen, 1984; Michielin
& Phillipson, 1997; Sparrow, 1982) suggests an upper
limit. Using the established link between P/N and r, we
estimate that disintegration of the complex dynamics of
flourishing first becomes evident at a positivity ratio of
11.6346.

>Two intertwined lessons within Figure 2 are that (a)
problems can occur with too much positivity (a point
also raised by Schwartz et al., 2002) and (b) appropriate
negativity may play an important role within the complex dynamics of human flourishing. 
Without appropriate negativity, behavior patterns calcify. We use the term
appropriate negativity because we suspect that certain
forms of negativity promote flourishing better than others.

To be sure, some kind of negative affect is required and there's
consensus on that. As for the ratio... it depends on whether the
suggested model bears any kind of resemblance to reality – and a simple
nonlinear system might be too weak to describe model of a team of
people.

## Discussion

We could describe the ratio of positive-negative interactions as a kind
of Gaussian function or some other nonlinear function, with interesting
points around 3 (zero), 5 (peak) and 11 (another zero).

Tthe idea that 
**too much positivity reduces the number of possible states the person can be in** 
(which causes stagnation and other effects as well) is a
pretty interesting one.

What does it mean is that we should operate within full spectrum of our
ability to feel. That way we'll be able to generate a wider range of
responses to that, what stimulates us and makes us grow. Certainly we
shouldn't remove certain kinds of affect from our lives.

In order to operate effectively we should strive for optimum, but it
also doesn't mean that a ratio of 1 or 0.5 is something that we should
avoid at all cost too. Nor fearing for it. It's important to find means
to resolve these kinds of relationships as quickly as possible.

I'm still curious about this ratio. On one side its a kind of reflection
of the reality and of Nature that has indifference towards whether we'll
be struck by a negative or a positive situation, but the ratio seems...
off. Or rather, biased towards a positive outlook on future. Or maybe it's a
cultural expectation. Was it similar throughout the history? Or maybe
people were accustomed to more grief in the past and the current ratio
is a product of recent times?

Or perhaps it's an indicator of the difference of our alertness to weak negative
stimuli (or numbness to satisfying stimuli)?

The ratio does not tell us anything about the amplitude of negative and
positive interations. It might resemblance to Machiavelli's words that:

> Injuries, therefore, should be inflicted all at once, that their 
> ill savour being less lasting may the less offend; whereas, 
> benefits should be conferred little by little, 
> that so they may be more fully relished.
